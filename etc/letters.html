            i dont care about the age gap and you might, i understand that. you turn 20 in hjuly and i’ll turn 16, which is weird to you. by the time you’re at least still 20 i’ll b graduating from high school.
            i promise you we can just keep it on the low at least, i promise you i can show you truly how i love and care for you, i really want to get to know you more and i rlly want something g between us, i remember you saying g you have commitment issues
            but i hope i can fix that
            i just wan you and only you, i would do anything for you  and i truly and honestly mean that
            i don’t know what’s enough to prove to you that i want you and i rlly want us to at least have something.. or more than something. im so deeply in love, “with what” WITH YOu
            the way i describe you is just idk, im sorry
