                love. it matters a lot to me, but i wonder what does it mean to other people. i wonder if it really matters to them. 
                THEM in this sense is pointing towards one person, the person i admired so much, the person who changed who i am as a person. 
                i s=till think about him even after he rejected me 3 times, notin some sense where he just said he didnt like me... what if he did, 
                i mean i could've been a chance that he cared about me. i wonder why am i like this... love takes a toll on me, when i fall in love 
                i deeply flal in love, to the epoint hwere im obessive and attached to people. it's something i need to work on. but with this guy, 
                m#$%#!@@#made me happy, i somehow fell in love w him, but i dont have a reason why i did, or even how it happened. he didnt pay any type of 
                attention to me, i just admired him from afar,, and i guess that was icky to him. it seems like it was... i hope it wasnt. i still think about him, 
                its been a while i had a crush, i had a crush since august. thats my birth month :D. it just never got this bad, i got freaking bad this year. 
                the way i would admire everything about him. i even started l;istening to his msuic in hopes he would fall for me. its whatever, 
                he has commiment issues mayeb thats the problem. or he just doesnt want to seem like a pedophile. 4 years isnt bad. hes turning 20 this year. 
                thats pretty old but... its ok, i didnt want to pay attention and focus on his age. i focused mainly upon him,... i wish he saw the way i loved on him lol.
                it sucks, i wrote him so many <a href="etc/letters.html">paragraphs</a> :c i wish he gave me a chance. I really do but guess what, its okay. i juist cant fall in love w someone else. 
                i truly felt love for thje first time, but who really cares lol. for some reason, whedn i speak about him and describe him i just get so soft, i just... cant descrie him.
